- Hi, my name is Jackson Franke, I'm a student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte studying Computer Science, with a concentration in AI, Robotics and Gaming.
- In my free time, I enjoy coding, working out, playing ultimate frisbee, and reading.
- Most of my learning consists of classes which teach Java and C, but I've also done work with Python before. 
- At the moment, I'm mainly looking for summer interships or part-time jobs that are flexible with school hours. 
- To reach out to me, my contact informations is listed below. I look forward to future projects with everyone, and any upcoming jobs.
